My personal blog, made with the following technologies:

- React.js
- JavaScript
- Styled Components
- CSS
- Prism React Renderer
- Sanity.io headless CMS

## TODOs

- [ ] fix tags associated with unpublished posts to not be displayed
- [ ] prevent top-of-post list bullets from being rendered where post image should be before it's loaded
- [ ] what's going on with the flicker on the background of the most recent post when dark/light modes are toggled?
- [ ] store theme preference in local storage
- [ ] add logic that checks if manual published date is set before sorting
- [ ] change how aside is serialized from asterisk
- [ ] setup code block rendering from within asides
- [ ] optimize loading data from Sanity
- [ ] figure out what's going on with blank spans around inline code?
